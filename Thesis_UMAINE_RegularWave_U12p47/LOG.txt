   Fully nonlinear model is employed.

 No free-surface pressure term is being applied.  

    SG(          13 ,          10 )-filtering will be employed after every            1  time step.
  
 No breaking model line found, the feature is off.
  
     Total relaxation zones defined:            1
  
 Found            1  pressure damping zones.
   Standard Cartesian model employed.

   Found            1  generation zones for the linear wave. (Only used for IncWaveType==2)
